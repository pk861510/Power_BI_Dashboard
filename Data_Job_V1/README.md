### 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an end-to-end **Power BI Dashboard** to analyze the global data job market. 

Rather than just looking at rows of data, I wanted to build a tool that helps understand the real value of different data roles. I used **Power Query** to clean and standardize raw job posting data, and then built an interactive dashboard that offers both a high-level market summary and a granular "deep dive" into specific job titles.

### 🎯 Key Business Questions
1. **Salary Benchmarking:** How do hourly and yearly salaries compare across different roles (e.g., Data Scientist vs. Analyst)?
2. **Hiring Trends:** Are job postings increasing or decreasing throughout the year?
3. **Degree Requirements:** Which countries and roles are most open to hiring candidates without a specific degree?
4. **Work Modality:** How common are **Work From Home (WFH)** options in the data field right now?
5. **Platform Efficiency:** Which platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.) actually have the most jobs?

### 🌟 Skills Showcased
- **🔄 ETL & Data Transformation:**
  - Used **Power Query** to clean raw data, fix missing values, and standardize currency formats.
  - Built conditional columns to separate "Full-time" jobs from "Contract" roles.
- **📈 Advanced Visualization:**
  - **Area Charts:** To visualize the trend of job postings over time.
  - **Map Charts:** To show the global spread of job opportunities.
  - **Scatter Plots:** To find the correlation between hourly and yearly pay rates.
- **🎛️ Interactive Reporting:**
  - **Slicers & Filters:** Created dynamic slicers so users can filter by Job Title.
  - **Drill-Through Actions:** The coolest feature—users can click a specific job title on the main page and "drill through" to a detailed page just for that role.
- **🎨 Dashboard Design:**
  - Designed clean **KPI Cards** for instant insights (Avg Salary, Total Jobs).
  - Used custom **Navigation Buttons** to make moving between pages smooth and app-like.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Tool:** Microsoft Power BI Desktop.
- **Data Transformation:** Power Query Editor (M Language).
- **Calculations:** DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
- **Data Source:** CSV / Excel (Raw Job Posting Data).

### 📊 Top Insights
- **Salary Hierarchy:** Data Scientists and Engineers generally earn more ($125k+), but Data Analysts have a higher volume of entry-level openings.
- **Degrees aren't always mandatory:** About **39%** of Data Analyst postings didn't explicitly demand a degree, showing a shift toward skills-based hiring.
- **LinkedIn is King:** The data shows **LinkedIn** has significantly more job postings than competitors like Indeed or BeBee for these roles.
- **Remote Work:** True WFH roles are competitive, making up about **10%** of the analyzed postings.

### 🚀 Future Scope
- **Real-time Data:** Connect this dashboard to a Python web scraper to fetch fresh job data every day.
- **Mobile Layout:** Optimize the view specifically for mobile portrait mode in Power BI.

### Conclusion
This dashboard showcases how Power BI can transform raw job posting data into a powerful tool for career analysis. It allows users to slice, filter, and drill through data to make informed decisions about their career paths.
