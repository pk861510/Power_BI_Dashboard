### 📌 Project Overview
This is the **2.0 evolution** of my Data Jobs analysis project. While the first version focused on exploratory depth, this version is engineered for **executive-level speed and clarity**.

I redesigned the entire architecture into a **streamlined, single-page dashboard** specifically for Job Seekers and Career Switchers. The goal was to reduce "time-to-insight" by consolidating critical metrics (Salary, Skill Demand, and Market Volume) into one cohesive view, eliminating the need for complex navigation.

### 🎯 Key Business Questions Solved
1.  **Market Demand:** Which technical skills (e.g., Python, SQL) are non-negotiable for high-paying roles?
2.  **Salary Benchmarking:** How does compensation vary between a *Data Analyst*, *Data Engineer*, and *Machine Learning Engineer*?
3.  **Role Complexity:** What is the average "Skill Load" (number of skills required) for a typical data role?
4.  **Opportunity Volume:** Where is the highest concentration of open positions in the current market?

### 🌟 Technical Skills & Competencies (Recruiter Optimized)
* **🎛️ Advanced Interactivity (Field Parameters):**
    * Implemented **Dynamic Field Parameters** to declutter the visual interface.
    * Users can seamlessly toggle chart axes between **Job Count vs. Job Percent** and **Median Yearly vs. Hourly Salary** via custom buttons, effectively combining 4 charts into 2 without sacrificing readability.
* **🧠 Complex DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):**
    * Engineered dynamic measures to calculate KPIs like **Median Salary** ($113K) on the fly, avoiding static pre-calculations.
    * Developed custom logic for **"Skills Per Job"** (4.75) to quantify the technical breadth required for different roles.
* **⚙️ ETL & Data Modeling (Power Query):**
    * Built a robust **Star Schema** data model to ensure fast query performance and accurate filtering.
    * Utilized **Power Query (M Language)** for robust data cleaning, type conversion, and handling null values to ensure data integrity.
* **🎨 UX/UI Design & Storytelling:**
    * Adopted a **Dark Mode aesthetic** for reduced visual fatigue and high-contrast data highlighting.
    * Applied **Gestalt Principles** to group related metrics (Salary vs. Skills), creating an intuitive "Z-pattern" flow for user attention.

### 📊 Top Insights (from Dashboard Analysis)
* **The "Big Three" Tech Stack:** **Python, SQL, and AWS** are the most dominant skills, appearing in the highest percentage of job postings across all data roles.
* **Compensation Leaders:** **Machine Learning Engineers** command the highest median salaries, followed closely by Data Engineers, significantly outpacing general Business Analyst roles.
* **Skill Breadth:** On average, employers demand **4.75 distinct skills** per job posting, suggesting a market preference for generalist capabilities.
* **Salary Baseline:** The global median yearly salary for data roles sits at **$113,000**, validating the high ROI of entering the data field.

### Conclusion
This dashboard demonstrates the ability to translate raw labor market data into actionable career intelligence. By combining **advanced features like Field Parameters** with **user-centric design**, it provides a tool that helps professionals make data-driven decisions about their upskilling and career trajectory.
